                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make this blog post, because I'm still a bit hyped, that my life is explained 
                    (despite that as of writing this, it's been 4 months since my diagnosis).
                    I also want to share my experience with the world.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h1>"How come you're able to X? My Y with autism...  "</h1>
                <p>
                    First of all, autism is a spectrum and manifests differently in each person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some autistic people may be very sensitive to sound, while others may struggle with hearing.
                    Some may hate bright and flashing lights, while others be fascinated by them.
                    Some may be very calm, while others may be playful and full of energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also autism doesn't always come with an intellectual disability, autistic people may even have a significantly higher level of intelligence
                    than an average person. <br>
                    <a href="https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-high-intelligence/" target="_blank">Link between autism and high intelligence.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The differences are huge. You shouldn't rely on stereotypes and assume all autistic people are the same, just because you met one.

                <h1 id="struggles">My struggles</h1>

                <h2>Poor mental health</h2>
                <p>
                    Before my diagnosis, I had very low self esteem and constantly repeated <i>What is wrong with me?!</i> in my head.
                    Forgiving myself for minor mistakes and awkward social situations were also big issue for me.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Social anxiety & masking</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been called <i>weird</i> or people said that <i>there is something wrong with me</i>, and that caused me to 
                    overthink about how I appeal to other people and fear that they'll judge me or think that I'm <i>weird</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've often observed other people act and copied their behavior to <i>better fit in</i>.
                    I also suppress my autistic traits, such as stimming.
                </p>

                <h2>Awkwardness</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not good at starting and handling conversations, and also getting social cues.
                    I developed <i>scripts</i> in my head for certain social situations that I feel I must follow and often
                    get confused and don't know how to act when something doesn't go as planned.
                </p>

                <h2>Bullying</h2>
                <p>
                    Luckily this is a past struggle, but people from other classes in my high school sometimes pick on me. 
                    I don't like that and just ignore them or run away, but I don't think that's bullying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In elementary school I've been heavily bullied by a large amount of my peers, to the point my mental health suffered at an age 
                    it really shouldn't have.
                    I think the bullying stopped when I learned how to ignore insults (now it's extremely hard to offend me as described in my about me)
                    and always stay calm, so people just didn't get what they want and got bored.
                    Also learning how to code and showing what I can do, gained me some respect.
                </p>

                <h2>Need for sameness and predictability</h2>
                <p>
                    I really hate change, unless I'm prepared well enough. 
                    Changes in appearance or location of things, plans and big routine changes often make me anxious or frustrated.
                    I also tend to always go to the same places on holidays as I know what to expect and I know that I'll like them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New and uncertain situations often make me very anxious.
                </p>

                <h2>Sensory sensitivity</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not gonna say a lot here, because my sensory issues are not that severe.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Smell</h3>
                <p>
                    I don't like strong smells and often stop hold my breath or cough to get rid of it when I smell something
                    and cover my nose if the methods described before don't help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has some advantages. Once I was able to detect a gas leak nobody else noticed the smell of until I told them. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm not a stereotypical autist who wears headphones or covers their ears all the time, but I'm bothered and startled by sounds
                    nobody else seems to care about. I also really enjoy silence and I feel a huge relief after a background noise stops, despite
                    not really noticing it.
                </p>

                <h2>Alexithymia</h2>
                <p>
                    It's often hard for me to describe my own emotions and read them from other people.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h1>How I found out</h1>

                <h2>There's something off about me...</h2>
                <p>
                    Before I learned about autism, I got interested in psychology and started watching and reading
                    content such as personality types, mental disorders and mental health.
                    I just assumed I'm an introvert and everyone else is an extrovert, yet I was still searching for something.
                </p>

                <h2>First suspicions</h2>
                <p>
                    In 9th grade, one person told me they suspect they might be autistic and showed me some online quiz results.
                    I found that test and wanted to do it just for fun. The results I got were high, so I did some searching and started suspecting myself as well.
                    But before I learned that sensory sensitivities manifest very differently in each person, I dropped all my suspicions due to that person
                    being very sensitive to sound, while I'm not. After that I started feeling guilty and continuing my psychology research.
                    I knew something was off about me and I was desperate to know what.
                </p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    After some time, I decided to continue my research and I ended up learning huge amount of information, so I started heavily suspecting myself again.
                    I also started gathering and noting every little piece of evidence that could be used in a diagnosis.
                </p>

                <h2>Judgement day - the diagnosis</h2>
                <p>
                    (Yes, I named it <i>Judgement day</i> on my calendar.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    On May 13 2024 I finally got diagnosed and all my suspicions and research were confirmed.
                    I also realized some things that I didn't really notice, such as instinctually noticing a pattern in objects and aligning
                    them according to that and having a monotone speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting diagnosed, I finally accepted myself as I am and started slowly unmasking, it was a huge relief and my life was
                    explained. My mental health has improved a lot since.
                    Despite already feeling complete, I haven't stopped researching autism. It even became my 2nd interest.
                </p>

                <h1>My traits</h1>
                <p>
                    Make sure to read the <a href="#struggles">struggles</a> section as it contains some autistic traits.
                </p>

                <h2>Stimming</h2>
                <p>
                    Scientifically known as <i>self stimulatory behavior</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I feel overwhelmed, stressed, happy or sometimes just bored, I do things like flapping my hands,
                    swinging my arms, shaking my legs and feet, pinching my skin or swaying.
                    However I'm aware that isn't not quite socially acceptable so I don't do anything noticeable when with other people.
                </p>

                <h2>Hyperfixations</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have a lot of interests I active participate in, but I'm very passionate about them.
                    Whenever I hear something about programming or autism I get very excited and a lot of information gets loaded from my memory into
                    my thoughts.
                    When I was younger, I could talk for hours about the thing I was currently interested in, it's referred to as <i>infodumping</i>.
                    Now I only do that when someone wants to know something or I just want to add something to the conversation.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h1>"Would you get rid of it if you could?"</h1>
                <p>
                    No.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite my struggles, I feel autism is an integral part of me and I would be a completely different person
                    as a neurotypical. Many autistic people have the same opinion.
                    Autism should be accommodated, not cured.
