                    I believe that everyone should have the basic idea about programming. 
                    You don't have to learn every single programming language on Earth and become a professional programmer, you just need a general
                    idea of how programming works and how to generally read code. Almost all programming languages follow the same rules.
                </p>

                <h1>The advantages</h1>

                <h2>Understanding and manipulating the source code</h2>
                <p>
                    Since you understand the source code, you should also be able to make a few basic edits to it, example changing text of messages,
                    disabling features you don't like or even modding if you're a bit more advanced.
                </p>

                <h3>Finding malicious code</h3>
                <p>
                    If you get your hands on the source code of a program, you are able to check if that program does anything malicious
                    (like sending HTTP requests to weird websites, reading sensitive files etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should also know how to spot obfuscated (unreadable) code. Hackers usually obfuscate their code to make reverse engineering
                    their malware more difficult.
