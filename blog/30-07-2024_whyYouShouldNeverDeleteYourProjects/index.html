                <h1>When do we delete our projects?</h1>
                <p>
                    We usually delete our projects when we think they are not good enough and they're just taking space on your hard drive.
                    This especially applies to projects from our early days of programming, but this can apply to anything, like Minecraft worlds
                    or edited videos. It's up to you what you consider a project.
                </p>

                <h1>Why is it a bad idea?</h1>
                <p>
                    At some point in your life you might want to go back to them because of nostalgia or when you just want to show them to
                    someone. 
                    Without your old projects that might've not been the best, you also won't be able to see from the start how you
                    progressed.
                </p>

                <h2>Public projects</h2>
                <p>
                    Deleting public projects is even worse, because someone could've actually been using or enjoying them without your knowledge,
                    and deleting them, makes it inaccessible, unless they've downloaded them.
                    One of my friends who used to upload on YouTube, suddenly deleted all of his old videos, because he didn't like them, while
                    I was really enjoying them. Seeing them gone made me highly disappointed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, you should archive them instead. On YouTube you could make your old videos unlisted.
                </p>

                <h1>Should really everything be kept?</h1>
                <p>
                    Depends on how much effort you've put into it. 
                    For example, if you have a very small unfinished program that can't even do the thing you want it to do, then you can delete it.
                    However if it's a game that's playable or some sort of a script that gets the job done, you should keep it.  
                </p>

            <section>
                <h1>Ok so I have to fill my hard drive with old junk?</h1>
                <p>
                    No. You can upload it to the web if it's not there already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it's a piece of software, you could upload it to a site like GitHub or GitLab.
                    If you decide to make it public (and if you assign a license that allows that), someone might fork your project's 
                    repository and continue working on it, carrying on your legacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also keep it on any file hosting website or a spare drive.
                </p>

                <h1>My experience</h1>
                <p>
                    I personally kept most of my projects related to programming on a spare drive and my PC, because they take me to the old
                    days of my journey and I can laugh at my mistakes. At some I might make them public too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also kept most of the videos I edited, except trimming and things like that. Only things that I've actually put effort into.
                </p>
                <h2>My regrets</h2>
                <p>
                    The thing I regret getting rid of the most are the comics I drew as a child. 
                    One day I just decided to throw all of them away, because they were childish. 
                    After a few years I regretted that and wanted to read them again. 
                    I can remember small pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of instantly throwing them away, I could've taken photos of each page and keep them digitally so they don't take up
                    space.
