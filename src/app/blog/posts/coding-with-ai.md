# Introduction

As more and more people are using AI tools such as ChatGPT or Claude to code, I think I could share my opinion about it.

# How to use AI properly when programming
AI is capable of doing quite a lot of things for you, but if you use it as your worker
instead of a helping tool you will not learn anything from it and potentially miss some critical bugs.
I'm strongly against *vibe coding*.

Instead, you should use AI to provide you with examples, explanations or to help with fixing a bug.

You should not blindly copy and paste the code generated by AI, but instead analyze it and then write your own
based on the code you've been provided with.
