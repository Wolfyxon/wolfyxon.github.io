# Why?

I think the previous version of my site was really cool, however it might've been confusing for people who are not familiar with the command line, as it required the user to type commands to reveal some extra info.

The text was small and the same size everywhere, and the site used a structure that might've been a bit confusing for screen readers, which makes the accessibility worse.

Also the site was quite buggy and barely usable on mobile.

That's why I remade the site. Now it's easy to navigate through, and it has more simplistic approach, while still keeping my style. 

# New features

As you can probably tell, I've added blogs, but I don't think I'll be posting here often. I've also added much more readable projects and other programmers section.

The terminal also received some new commands. 

# Conclusion

 So I hope you like the remake I guess. This is the 4th version so far.

The previous site is archived on [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614080017/https://wolfyxon.github.io/), 
as well as [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/wolfyxon.github.io/releases/tag/3.0) if you ever want to check it out.

See you later!
