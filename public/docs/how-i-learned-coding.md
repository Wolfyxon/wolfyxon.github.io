# Introduction
I was very passionate about computers and technology since I was little.
I liked to tweak everything and experiment with all the features of the software I could get my hands on.
I also had a liking for keyboard shortcuts which make everything faster and not require you to use your mouse.

From time to time I liked to edit videos and
in IT classes in primary school I was always trying to impress my teachers by making the fanciest PowerPoint presentations possible.

If I ever encountered an issue I was desperate to resolve it by searching the internet until I could fix it.

# The beginning
When I was 9 I discovered [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and then [Construct](https://www.construct.net/en) thanks to a friend,
where I made some games.
After moving from Scratch to Construct (Construct 2 at the time) I was amazed by all the possibilities and wanted to expand my skills further into
actual programming.

# Learning the basics
I was once wondering how websites are made and found some YouTube tutorial which explained how to make websites in Notepad using HTML.
Then after a lot of messing around I made a very a basic site with a lot of spaghetti code and deprecated HTML features.
This was my first experience with coding.

Some time later I asked my parents to enroll me in a programming course so I can learn more.

They found [Giganci Programowania](https://www.giganciprogramowania.edu.pl) where I revised Scratch, learned the basics of programming,
Python, basic Android apps, C# and .NET forms, web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and then the basics of cybersecurity.
I was often ahead of the things that were taught there.

I learned a lot there, but the majority of the things I learned came from me experimenting and coding my own stuff at home.

# Expansion
During the pandemic in 2020, I started working on [Hero of the Earth](https://wolfyxon.itch.io/hote) in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), which was my first major project.
I also made some private Discord bots at the time with DiscordJS in JavaScript.

Later I got really comfortable with web development, mostly frontend and some backend. 
I was also making a lot of small projects, mostly private ones.
I also made a few small Minecraft plugins and mods in Java.

After switching to Linux I made some automation scripts for my system.

# Current times
Recently I learned PHP, Rust, C, learned more about C++ and learned how to use SQL databases.

I'm currently expanding my skills into low-level programming and embedded devices and working on my current projects.
I want to constantly improve and become a better programmer, but also help others start coding too.

My goal is to create my own dream programming language at some point.
