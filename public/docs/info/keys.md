description: How to import my public key and use it to verify releases

# Introduction
I use **GnuPG** to sign the release files of the most of my projects.
It ensures that I am the author of the files and they haven't been tampered with.

**GnuPG** is a program for making digital signatures and encrypting data, based on the 
[PGP system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy).

You can copy and import it. 
Below are commands that will allow you to do this or with an alternative way.

## Import commands
Various methods of importing my key via the command line.

### From URL
```
curl https://wolfyxon.github.io/resources/gpg/wolfyxon.gpg |Â gpg --import -

**NOTE:** Not all Windows versions have `curl` installed by default, so you may want to use an other method or install it first.

`curl` is used to send HTTP request to retrieve files and contents of websites. 

### From a key server
https://keys.openpgp.org/
```
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --receive-keys FCF9C691B23E1DFC
``` 

### From file
```
gpg --import <file>
```
Examples:
```
gpg --import Downloads/wolfyxon.gpg
```
```
gpg --import C:\Users\CoolPerson\Downloads\wolfyxon.txt
```

```
gpg --verify CoolGame.zip.sig
```
