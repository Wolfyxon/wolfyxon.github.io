# Introduction

In this guide I'll cover the ways you can better protect your identity and data on the internet without compromising your convenience. 

This will not be a *live off grid*, *delete all of your online accounts*, *use the Tor network* but a practical guide that will still allow you to normally use the internet.
I will also not talk about Linux and open source software here because I'm aware that this is not a viable option for most people even though that's what I use and encourage.

# Why should I care?
If you're a person that openly shares their life on the internet, this may not be a guide for you.
Me personally and many people I know, prefer to be as anonymous and disconnected from their real world identity as possible.

# Protecting your information

## Google yourself
Searching for yourself on the internet is the first step to protect your data by identifying what information is public about you.
Then you can try getting rid of it.

## Get rid or isolate Facebook
It's common knowledge that Facebook collects very large amounts of your data but that data is often not private.
Facebook is a true doxxing ground and I strongly do not recommend using it.
If you use or ever actively used Facebook there's a very high chance your real life identity can be found through it.

### Liked and followed content
Almost all of your activity on Facebook can be searched on the platform and through Google which can only be slightly reduced in your settings.

If you've ever done things like followed your town page or liked a post of a local restaurant this can be an obvious sign of where you live.
### Getting doxxed via your friends
Let's say you successfully adjusted your account settings, disappeared from searches and your profile is invisible, well it's not.

No matter how well you hide your profile it's still visible on your friends' profiles.
Unless all of your friend connections are well educated on privacy (which is unlikely) they most likely openly share everything about their lives, which put you at risk.

This may sound a bit harsh, but you should delete all of your friends on Facebook.
But don't worry, if you use Messenger this will not impact your ability to communicate.

## Be extremely careful with what you share

### Photos and videos of the outside
I'm not gonna explain it in detail, you can do your own research. You can see a YouTube channel called *rainbolt* which shows how simple it is.

I'll just say that showing even a small bit of the outside environment is extremely dangerous as there are various methods of finding the exact location of the place showcased on the photo or video.

Do not share any photos or videos of the outside world online.
### Your school data
If you're still going to school, do not share any information about it, such as:
- Your plan
- Teacher names
- Times (not all schools may follow the same pattern)

If your plan is available on your school's website, with enough effort someone will be able to match it.

The most dangerous one in my opinion is the full names of your teachers.
There's a very high chance the majority of your teachers use Facebook and don't properly care about the privacy which makes your school very easy to find from their profile, which obviously leads back to you.

## Assume everything may be leaked eventually
The even the most *secure* companies suffer data breaches leaving data of thousands of users open to cybercriminals.

Still be careful what data you give to companies and what you privately save on an account as you never know when your account will be hacked or there will be a data breach.

# Prevent companies from spying on you
As you probably know, in these days all tech companies spy on you and sell your data for advertising. However luckily we have some laws that require them to at least give us an option to limit the way they can spy on us.

## Don't blindly agree to everything
That big shiny *consent to all* button you see and blindly click when you visit a website?
Well have you ever actually read what you're consenting to?
Often when you read deeper you will find that the website tracks your behavior and then sells it to companies to show you better ads.

You should always decline everything you don't need, even if it takes an extra minute to uncheck all the boxes (if they don't have a disagree button).

## Disable ad personalization
Have you ever talked about something and the next minute you see it in an ad on your phone? 
You're not crazy, your phone is actually listening to you, do some research if you don't believe me.

Your Android phone, most apps and websites will track everything you do and sometimes even use your microphone to show you better ads and sell that info to companies.
You should disable that.

# Keeping your accounts secure
This will cover some obvious examples, but from my experience way too many people don't follow those practices so I think I should cover them.

## Use different passwords on every website
What would happen if someone guessed it? Or if your password got leaked?
Well, know your WHOLE digital identity is now someone else's hands.

*Well but I won't remember all my passwords* just use a password manager, I don't remember most of my passwords either.
A password manager is a program that stores your logins and passwords in an encrypted database.

## Use 2-factor authentication
Two factor authentication is an additional guard for your accounts which protects them even if someone finds your password.
It's available on virtually all websites and you can find it in your account settings.

For example it can work by e-mailing you a verification code that you have to enter after your password.

# Stay away from malware

## Don't download programs from untrusted sources
This is pretty self explanatory.
When you install a program, make sure to verify you're downloading it form a trusted source and that the developer has good reputation.
If the said source has reviews and statistics, make sure to check if the program is used by enough people already.

## Don't plug in random USB drives you find
Your curiosity may be strong but this is seriously unsafe.
Even if you don't run any programs from that USB, are you really sure it's just a USB drive?
It could also act as an automated keyboard performing tasks on your computer in the blink of an eye.

## Use the latest software
Make sure to update your software from time to time.
New versions of programs can include fixes for bugs that can allow hackers to install malware on your device or steal your data.

# Educate and protect others

## Don't dox others
I know you're gonna get angry and furious at people sometimes, however you have to stay civil.
Sharing someone's private information can do permanent damage to their lives and sometimes the info cannot be deleted.
You will regret it and they will suffer.

However you may also dox them unintentionally so be careful with what you share about them the same way you are careful with what you share about yourself.
Protect them.

## Educate others
Educate others on how they can stay safe online and protect their privacy.
Let them know of the dangers and how to avoid them.
Make your own guides like this to share with the world.

Stay safe, stay private and goodbye.
